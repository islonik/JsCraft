# Simple Working Calculator

This project was done for <b>'Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate'</b> and demonstrates the simplest React App and how to test it using <b>'React Testing Library'</b> for simple testing.

## Used hooks
### State
<b>useState</b> hook can work with primitive (string) data and with complex data (state stored in objects)
In this project, state is stored in a primitive data string.

```js
// declare
const [result, setResult] = useState(0); 

// update
setResult((result) => result + Number(inputRef.current.value)); 
```

### Ref
<b>useRef</b> hook helps your to persist values between renders.

It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated.

It can be used to access a DOM element directly.

```js

// create
const inputRef = useRef(0); 

// use
setResult((result) => result + Number(inputRef.current.value)); 

// render input
<input
    id="input"
    pattern="[0-9]" 
    ref={inputRef} 
    type="number" 
    placeholder="Type a number" 
/> 
```

### Effect
<b>useEffect</b> hook lets you synchronize a component with an external system or provide an external change to the app.

```js
useEffect(() => {
    document.body.style.background = theme === "light" ? "white" : "black";
});
```

### Theme
<b>useTheme</b> helps building Light/Dark theme on the app. Custom-made.

```js
// import 
import { useTheme } from "../ThemeContext";

// create
const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();
```

## Generated by default

This math calculator was created using command:
```console
npx create-react-app my-app
```

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

##### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

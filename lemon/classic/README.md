# Little Lemon
This project was done as part of <b>Meta-Front End Developer Professional Certificate</b>

Little lemon is a SPA (Single Page Application) made as a simple static HTML5 website with native JS functions and CSS styles. 

### Notes

The difference between style.visibility and style.display:
* visibility:hidden renders the tag, but isn't seen on the page.
* style.display doesn't render the tag.

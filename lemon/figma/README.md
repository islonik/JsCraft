### Problem definition
Little Lemon has a problem - booking a table provides a bad user experience. 

We need to need to understand how Little Lemon can improve it's UI to significantly improve a user experience.

To do that I'm going to create a user persona, a user journey map, wireframes and a prototype.

### User persona
<b>User persona</b> is a semi-fictional character based on your current (or ideal) customer. Personas can be created by talking to users and segmenting by various demographic and psychographic data to improve your product marketing.

### Journey map
<b>Journey map</b> is a synthetic representation that describes step-by-step how a user interacts with a service. The process is mapped from the user perspective, describing what happens at each stage of the interaction, what touchpoints are involved, what obstacles and barriers they may encounter. The journey map is often integrated an additional layers representing the level of positive/negative emotions experienced throughout the interaction.

### Wireframe
<b>Wireframe</b> is a two-dimensional illustration of a page’s interface that specifically focuses on space allocation and prioritization of content, functionalities available, and intended behaviors. For these reasons, wireframes typically do not include any styling, color, or graphics. Wireframes also help establish relationships between a website’s various templates.

### Prototype
<b>Figma prototype</b> allows you to create interactive flows that explore how a user may interact with your designs. Prototypes are an excellent way to preview interactions and user flows and share and iterate on ideas.

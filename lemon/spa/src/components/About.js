                    <p>Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12â€“15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Little Lemon is owned by two Italian sisters, Mirka and Isabella, who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mirka relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. Isabella does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.</p>
